Project Alert: Notifications Page (Main)

Objective:
The purpose of this project is to create a notifications page that displays alerts to the user in real-time using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page will consist of a simple notification system that allows users to see updates, alerts, or messages that appear dynamically.
Project Overview:

    HTML (Structure):
    The page is built with HTML to structure the layout of notifications. It includes:
        A container for the notifications.
        A button to simulate adding new notifications.
        A dismiss button for removing individual notifications.

    CSS (Styling):
    The notifications are styled to be visually distinct and user-friendly. The page features:
        A clean, modern layout with responsive design.
        Notifications appear as floating elements at the top-right of the screen.
        Different notification types (success, error, info) with distinct colors.

    JavaScript (Functionality):
    JavaScript is used to:
        Dynamically add notifications to the page.
        Allow the user to dismiss individual notifications by clicking on a close button.
        Automatically remove notifications after a certain period.

Key Features:

    Real-Time Notifications:
    Notifications are generated and displayed dynamically when triggered (e.g., through a button click).

    Customizable Notification Types:
    Notifications can be styled differently based on the type (success, error, information, etc.).

    Auto-Close Functionality:
    Notifications will automatically disappear after a set time, but the user can also manually dismiss them by clicking the close button.

    Responsive Design:
    The notifications adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
